When encountering a rebound shell, do you find that VPS has expired again?

Want to test something bad, but don't have a virtual machine at hand? Do I need to take a snapshot to protect myself when running a virtual machine?

I really want a temporarily available host at this time, so I can discard it without the need for further management.

Trickster is based on the Collie management platform and Github Action trigger, allowing you to make a curl request and immediately obtain a temporary host.

Here is an example of a curl request that can be sent to quickly launch a host.

```shell
curl \     
-X POST \
-H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_GITHUB_ACTION>"\
-H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
https://api.github.com/repos/<YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME>/<YOUR_GITHUB_REPOS>/actions/workflows/<YOUR_CI_FILE>/dispatches \
-d '{"ref":"main","inputs":{"token":"<YOUR_TOKEN>","type": "linux"}'
```

Among them:
+ <YOU_ GITHUB_ Action>: Token authentication for github configuration  
+ <YOU_ GITHUB_ USER_ Name>: Your GitHub account name  
+ <YOU_ CI_ File>: The script to be executed is a file in the directory '. github/workflows/', such as' github '_ Linux_ Ubuntu. yaml ` indicates that this request is for a Linux type ubuntu host from GitHub to be launched  
+ <YOU_ GITHUB_ REPOS>: The warehouse name of your fork, usually just write 'Trickster' directly for the fork.  
+ <YOU_ The Token generated by Changting Mu Cloud Host Assistant.
